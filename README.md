# TheirdPerson-Controller Using CSharp


      Build a TheirdPersonController (action/combat/parkour):
      The PlayerController must use In-Unity CharacterController class.
      This Controller will have the abilities to do some crazy parkour mechanics, magic-like abillies and cool combat system.
      Also this Project will be in a NameSpace for later use in a bigger project...

      Camera Controller:
      Just a simple camera controller to do ma damn work, for now...
      In the life time of the project may I remake it again for better use and performance.

      If you find any piece of your code in mine, Thanks you!
      Peace.
